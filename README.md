AI LMS (Learning Management System) is an intelligent platform designed to generate personalized study material based on the user’s learning goals—be it online preparation, interview readiness, coding practice, or other educational pursuits. Leveraging the power of Google’s Gemini Model API, the system dynamically curates high-quality content tailored to the user's preferences and requirements.

The platform features a seamless and secure authentication flow powered by Clerk.com, ensuring user identity management is both modern and reliable. It utilizes Neon as the cloud database for efficient and scalable data storage, while Inngest is integrated to manage background tasks and event-driven workflows such as study material generation.

AI LMS not only provides curated content but also keeps track of when users generate their study material, offering a transparent and structured learning experience.
